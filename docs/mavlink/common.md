# Subset of Common Set

These messages are reproduced from the original documentation at [mavlink.io â€“ MAVLink Common Message Set](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html). This is **only a subset of the full list**, including only messages used in the MARSH project, to make the protocol less overwhelming.

Before designing a new message, first check the original documentation linked above. If you find a useful message in the common set, consider [editing](https://github.com/marsh-sim/marsh-sim.github.io/edit/main/docs/mavlink/common_subset.txt) the [list of identifiers](./common_subset.txt) used for generating this page.
