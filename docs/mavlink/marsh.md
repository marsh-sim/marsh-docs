# MARSH Dialect

This page documents all extensions to MAVLink that were required for the simulator.

The definitions are in the [marsh.xml file](https://github.com/marsh-sim/mavlink/blob/dialect/message_definitions/v1.0/marsh.xml) on the [`dialect` branch](https://github.com/marsh-sim/mavlink/tree/dialect) in our fork of main [MAVLink repository](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink).
All other projects need to generate and appropriate libraries, following the [mavlink.io â€“ Generating MAVLink Libraries](https://mavlink.io/en/getting_started/generate_libraries.html) documentation.

When in need of a definition for a given functionality which is not covered here, first consult the Common Message Set, both [our subset](./common.md) and [full list](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html). If a new definition is actually needed, follow the original guide on [how to define MAVLink Messages & Enums](https://mavlink.io/en/guide/define_xml_element.html)
