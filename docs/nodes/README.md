# Simulator nodes

The purpose of nodes is to maintain the [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) principle.
In short, if each node has a single responsibility, it is easier to reuse them in new ways and avoid repeating work (see&nbsp;[rationale](../rationale.md)).

Nodes created so far have been collected in the [marsh-sim/sim-nodes repository](https://github.com/marsh-sim/sim-nodes).
You are welcome to ask questions, report bugs and contribute new scripts there.
