Downloading the source code To use our own dialect, the project depends on a fork of MAVLink , included as a Git Submodule (which in turn has pymavlink inside). Open the folder where you want to keep the project code, and open it in terminal. To clone the repository with its inner modules, add the --recursive flag: git clone https://github.com/marsh-sim/marsh-manager.git --recursive cd marsh-manager Note If you didn't get the submodules during clone, or they changed to a different commit, you can update them with: git submodule update --init --recursive Building the project MAVLink library After downloading the project for the first time, or after changes in the MAVLink dialect, the communication library needs to be regenerated.

The project can be compiled and optionally built using the buttons in the bottom left corner, or the \"Build\" menu on the top menu bar. This should rebuild all the necessary files, and optionally start the application and attach a debugger. Note The details of application version are generated by CMake based on last Git commit. You should fully run CMake after every commit.

Based on RFC-5424 using expanded definitions at: http://www.kiwisyslog.com/kb/info:-syslog-message-levels/. Value Field Name Description 0 MAV_SEVERITY_EMERGENCY System is unusable. This is a \"panic\" condition. 1 MAV_SEVERITY_ALERT Action should be taken immediately. Indicates error in non-critical systems. 2 MAV_SEVERITY_CRITICAL Action must be taken immediately. Indicates failure in a primary system. 3 MAV_SEVERITY_ERROR Indicates an error in secondary/redundant systems. 4 MAV_SEVERITY_WARNING Indicates about a possible future error if this is not resolved within a given timeframe. Example would be a low battery warning. 5 MAV_SEVERITY_NOTICE An unusual event has occurred, though not an error condition. This should be investigated for the root cause. 6 MAV_SEVERITY_INFO Normal operational messages. Useful for logging. No action is required for these messages. 7 MAV_SEVERITY_DEBUG Useful non-operational messages that can assist in debugging. These should not occur during normal operation. MAVLink Commands ( MAV_CMD ) MAVLink commands ( MAV_CMD ) and messages are different! These commands define the values of up to 7 parameters that are packaged INSIDE specific messages used in the Mission Protocol and Command Protocol. Use commands for actions in missions or if you need acknowledgment and/or retry logic from a request. Otherwise use messages. Commands to be executed by the MAV. They can be executed on user request, or as part of a mission script. If the action is used in a mission, the parameter mapping to the waypoint/mission message is as follows: Param 1, Param 2, Param 3, Param 4, X: Param 5, Y:Param 6, Z:Param 7. This command list is similar what ARINC 424 is for commercial aircraft: A data format how to interpret waypoint/mission data. NaN and INT32_MAX may be used in float/integer params (respectively) to indicate optional/default values (e.g. to use the component's current yaw or latitude rather than a specific value). See https://mavlink.io/en/guide/xml_schema.html#MAV_CMD for information about the structure of the MAV_CMD entries MAVLink Messages PARAM_REQUEST_READ ( #20 ) [Message] Request to read the onboard parameter with the param_id string id. Onboard parameters are stored as key[const char*] -> value[float]. This allows to send a parameter to any other component (such as the GCS) without the need of previous knowledge of possible parameter names. Thus the same GCS can store different parameters for different autopilots. See also https://mavlink.io/en/services/parameter.html for a full documentation of QGroundControl and IMU code. Field Name Type Description target_system uint8_t System ID target_component uint8_t Component ID param_id char[16] Onboard parameter id, terminated by NULL if the length is less than 16 human-readable chars and WITHOUT null termination (NULL) byte if the length is exactly 16 chars - applications have to provide 16+1 bytes storage if the ID is stored as string param_index int16_t Parameter index. Send -1 to use the param ID field as identifier (else the param id will be ignored) PARAM_REQUEST_LIST ( #21 ) [Message] Request all parameters of this component. After this request, all parameters are emitted. The parameter microservice is documented at https://mavlink.io/en/services/parameter.html Field Name Type Description target_system uint8_t System ID target_component uint8_t Component ID PARAM_VALUE ( #22 ) [Message] Emit the value of a onboard parameter. The inclusion of param_count and param_index in the message allows the recipient to keep track of received parameters and allows him to re-request missing parameters after a loss or timeout. The parameter microservice is documented at https://mavlink.io/en/services/parameter.html Field Name Type Values Description param_id char[16] Onboard parameter id, terminated by NULL if the length is less than 16 human-readable chars and WITHOUT null termination (NULL) byte if the length is exactly 16 chars - applications have to provide 16+1 bytes storage if the ID is stored as string param_value float Onboard parameter value param_type uint8_t MAV_PARAM_TYPE Onboard parameter type. param_count uint16_t Total number of onboard parameters param_index uint16_t Index of this onboard parameter PARAM_SET ( #23 ) [Message] Set a parameter value (write new value to permanent storage). The receiving component should acknowledge the new parameter value by broadcasting a PARAM_VALUE message (broadcasting ensures that multiple GCS all have an up-to-date list of all parameters). If the sending GCS did not receive a PARAM_VALUE within its timeout time, it should re-send the PARAM_SET message. The parameter microservice is documented at https://mavlink.io/en/services/parameter.html. PARAM_SET may also be called within the context of a transaction (started with MAV_CMD_PARAM_TRANSACTION ). Within a transaction the receiving component should respond with PARAM_ACK_TRANSACTION to the setter component (instead of broadcasting PARAM_VALUE ), and PARAM_SET should be re-sent if this is ACK not received.

It is in mayday and going down. 7 MAV_STATE_POWEROFF System just initialized its power-down sequence, will shut down now. 8 MAV_STATE_FLIGHT_TERMINATION System is terminating itself (failsafe or commanded). MAV_COMPONENT [Enum] Component ids (values) for the different types and instances of onboard hardware/software that might make up a MAVLink system (autopilot, cameras, servos, GPS systems, avoidance systems etc.). Components must use the appropriate ID in their source address when sending messages. Components can also use IDs to determine if they are the intended recipient of an incoming message. The MAV_COMP_ID_ALL value is used to indicate messages that must be processed by all components. When creating new entries, components that can have multiple instances (e.g. cameras, servos etc.) should be allocated sequential values. An appropriate number of values should be left free after these components to allow the number of instances to be expanded. Value Field Name Description 0 MAV_COMP_ID_ALL Target id (target_component) used to broadcast messages to all components of the receiving system. Components should attempt to process messages with this component ID and forward to components on any other interfaces.

MAVLink Messages HEARTBEAT ( #0 ) [Message] The heartbeat message shows that a system or component is present and responding. The type and autopilot fields (along with the message component id), allow the receiving system to treat further messages from this system appropriately (e.g. by laying out the user interface based on the autopilot). This microservice is documented at https://mavlink.io/en/services/heartbeat.html Field Name Type Values Description type uint8_t MAV_TYPE Vehicle or component type. For a flight controller component the vehicle type (quadrotor, helicopter, etc.). For other components the component type (e.g. camera, gimbal, etc.). This should be used in preference to component id for identifying the component type. autopilot uint8_t MAV_AUTOPILOT Autopilot type / class. Use MAV_AUTOPILOT_INVALID for components that are not flight controllers. base_mode uint8_t MAV_MODE_FLAG System mode bitmap. custom_mode uint32_t A bitfield for use for autopilot-specific flags system_status uint8_t MAV_STATE System status flag. mavlink_version uint8_t_mavlink_version MAVLink version, not writable by user, gets added by protocol because of magic data type: uint8_t_mavlink_version PROTOCOL_VERSION ( #300 ) WORK IN PROGRESS: Do not use in stable production environments (it may change). [Message] (MAVLink 2) Version and capability of protocol version. This message can be requested with MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE and is used as part of the handshaking to establish which MAVLink version should be used on the network. Every node should respond to a request for PROTOCOL_VERSION to enable the handshaking. Library implementers should consider adding this into the default decoding state machine to allow the protocol core to respond directly.
